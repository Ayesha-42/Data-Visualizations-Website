# Data Visualizations Website
 
This project aims to examine the current framework of waste management in Australia. Narrowing the focus in this radar, this document provides an insight on how waste is accumulated in staggering amounts from multiple sources and quantitively tracks its journey and outlets of consumptions and re-circulation. It extrapolates on these points supported by statistical data on its impact on the overall health of the environment and the goals of sustainability.



Bootstrap has been used in the website design as part of an iterative final version of the website's interface.

There is a stacked bar chart design, where each composite bar glyph represents a financial year (x-axis), and each subsection of each bar contains a length-coded value representing each waste generator by sector. Color Hue is used to represent each subsection waste generator, with a legend underneath the chart matching each color hue with a particular waste generator to guide the user. The idea is to use two keys, primary-key (x-axis) and secondary-key (y-axis) where a user can look up pertinent data via either of the keys, either by tonnes per $million or by date.
